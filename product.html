    <h2>Future Product</h2>
    <p>
      CYCLOOP is a smart bin accurately and automatically sorting rubbish on an individual level. It is a substitute for traditional bins. Instead of having 2-4 different bins next to each other, there is one bin, with one hole, which automatically sorts 4-6 different materials. CYCLOOP eliminates waste contamination and the loss of recyclable materials. Thus, it reduces cost along the whole waste management chain from consumers up to waste processing plants. In keeping materials in the circle for reuse and recycling, CYCLOOP contributes to Circular Economy, decreases new material sourcing, energy usage, and carbon emission concentration. 

      CYCLOOP aims to have a stake in the fight against climate change.
